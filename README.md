# raaskallers

Raaskallers is a policy visualizer. It's goal is to provide accessible insight in 
long term policies and strategies of parties & representatives around several main 
themes, so civilians can use its historical data to judge policy claims made around
election time.

Raaskallers is developed against [open data](https://opendata.tweedekamer.nl)
of the Dutch parlement (Tweede kamer) and is currently at the stage of pre-R&D
prototype.
