# krateo

Krateo is a policy visualizer for *the* people in democratic countries.
It's goal is to provide **accessible** insight in long term policies and
strategies of parties & representatives around several main themes, so
people can use its historical data to judge policy claims made around
election time.

Krateo is developed against [open data](https://opendata.tweedekamer.nl)
of the Dutch parlement (Tweede kamer) and is currently at the stage of pre-R&D
prototype. Its goal is to make it easy to port the same system to other
democracies.
